# AndroidZoomableViewGroup 

I spent a day looking for a Zoomable ListView and every answer was broken in some way. 
Finally I found a great template and made a couple changes to handle scroll boundaries.

Thanks to ricky on stackoverflow.  I used his ZoomableListView and made a couple changes.

You can extend any view and this will work nicely. 
This version has a few changes to prevent a user from scrolling off screen.  
Feel free to try it out.  It is really easy to implement.

# AndroidZoomableViewGroup 

I spent a whole day looking for a zoomable viewgroup.
Many were broken and would never work for something like a listview or a viewgroup.

Thanks to ricky on stackoverflow.  I used his ZoomableListView and made a couple changes.

You can extend any view and this will work nicely.
The version here has a few changes to prevent a user from scrolling the view to far.
